## Comment:</br>
1. Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly.</br>
2. the data supports the project: define the 75 percentile age as old and use the tripduration as features</br>
3. The analysis is clear and good.</br> 
4. But I think the plot does not show the evidence that old people take longer tripduration, at least not intuitively.</br>

## Suggestion:</br>
It will be better if the average trip time of old people and young people can be plotted.</br>

## Test:</br>
It's quite clear that t-test should be used to verify the hypothesis.</br>
Calculate the value t=(t1-t2)/sqrt(sigma1/n1+sigma2/n2).</br>
where t1 stands for average time of old people, t2 for young people. sigma1 for standard deviation of the old people sample and n1 for the size. etc
