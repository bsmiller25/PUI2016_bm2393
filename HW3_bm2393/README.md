# PUI 2016 HW3

In this HW I used Python's random module to explore various distributions and their fit to the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem. I then explored the Citibike data, developing an idea, null hypothesis, and alternate hypotheis. I then began to consider the idea by graphically exploring the distributions.

Finally I finished the lab from class completing a Z test.

I worked with Geoff. 


## Assignment 1: 

I worked through the first few distributions and Geoff did the last few. We then labeled the figures, interpreting the results, together.

## Assignment 2: 

Geoff and I worked together to brain storm ideas, develop the hypotheses, and display the data.

## Lab 3:

I finished this in class. Added some comments afterwards.

## Extra Credit:

Not yet done.
