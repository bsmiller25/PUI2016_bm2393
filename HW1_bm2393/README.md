# PUI 2016 HW1


## Assignment 1: Finish Lab 1

I finished the lab from class. This entailed setting up a test github repo, adding a text file to it, resolving merge conflicts, and collaboration.

I forked Tashay's repo, made a change, and submitted a pull request which she accepted. 

She then submitted a pull request to my repo which I accepted.


## Assignment 2: Set up my environment

I had to set up my environment to run in a way consistent with the rest of the class. This allows for maximum reproducibility and collaboration!

I added environmental variables and aliases to my .bashrc file:

And then I tested it to make sure that they worked:
