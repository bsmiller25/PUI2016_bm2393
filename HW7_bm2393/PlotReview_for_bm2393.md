### Plot Assignment(bm2393) LINK: https://github.com/xingezhong/PUI2016_bm2393/blob/master/HW7_bm2393/Assignment1.ipynb

## Clarity
### The title of the plot, the legend of the plot, the y label of the plot(with unit " $billions"), all these are totally perfect! When I read your plot for the first time, I knew that you're trying to compare the amount of treasury and MBS securities that the Federal Reserves held during the 2007-2016. And it's also very wise to transfer the millions to billions, so we can catch some key turning points in the plot figure.
### While you may think the xlabel is too straightforward. You didn't add the x label, but I think maybe sometimes it's even smarter to refrain your smartness! Please add it by simply "Time(year)", or you are definitely able to come up with some better ideas!

## Esthetic
### Thanks a lot! You used seaborn!!!
### Seaborn contains much nicer color palettes than matplotlib and much other default condition, such as grid context, which you can only achieved by coding extra "plt.grid(True)".

## Honesty
### Sorry to speak of improvements in the honesty section. You did contain a caption in your figure. Besides, I can tell that you're trying to tell a story of what happened in Federal Reserves in 2009. And you externally explained that smaller amount of Agency Debt and other securities are not showed indivisually in plot but are included in the "total line".
### My advice is since you're really focused on the 2009 year, why not add a special mark in this year, just like we did when using pen and paper. Truely speaking, I don't know how to do this. But I regard you as someone smartter than me, so can you please figure out the method and tell me after you achieve this?
