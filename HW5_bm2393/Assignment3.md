# Assignment 3

## Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?  

#### Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.  

Null Hypothesis: On average, participants in the test sample lose significantly less or the same amount of weight than participants in the control sample.  
Alternate Hypothesis: Participants in the test sample lose significantly more weight than participants in the control sample.
Alpha: .05   

H0: WeightLoss.test - WeightLoss.control >= 0  
H1: WeightLoss.test - WeightLoss.control < 0  

## Do American trust the president?  

#### POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.  

Null Hypothesis: The proportion of Americans who say they trust the president is significantly less than or the same as the proportion of Americans who say they do not trust the president.  
Alternate Hypothesis: The proportion of Americans who say they trust the president is significantly greater than the proportion of Americans who say they do not trust the president.   
Alpha: .05   

H0: P(Trust) - P(Distrust) <= 0  
H1: P(Trust) - P(Distrust) > 0  

## Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.

#### Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

Null Hypothesis: The cessation rate for smokers assigned the nicotine patch is significantly less than or equal to the cessation rate of smokers assigned the placebo.  
Alternate Hypothesis: The cessation rate for smokers assigned the nicotine patch is significantly greater than the cessation rate of smokers assigned the placebo.   
Alpha: .05  

H0: P(quitters | nicotine) - P(quitters | placebo) <= 0  
H1: P(quitters | nicotine) - P(quitters | placebo) > 0  

## Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women

#### Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Null Hypothesis: On average, the IQ of children of smokers at ages (1,2,3,4) is the same as or significantly greater than the IQ of children of nonsmokers at ages (1,2,3,4).  
Alternate Hypothesis: On average, the IQ of children of smokers at ages (1,2,3,4) is significantly less than the IQ of children of nonsmokers at ages (1,2,3,4).  
Alpha: .05  

H0: IQ.smoker - IQ.nonsmoker <= 0   
H1: IQ.smoker - IQ.nonsmoker > 0
