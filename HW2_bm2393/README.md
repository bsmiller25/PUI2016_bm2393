# PUI 2016 HW2

In this HW I used an API to download and analyze MTA bus data. I then used the CUSP datahub to download and analyze data using Pandas.

I worked with Geoff. 

At the beginning of this HW, I wrote a python script that downloads data from the MTA API using a passed Busline and API. The script writes the json file locally. Each assignment program uses this script to download the data. 

## Assignment 1: tracking each vehicle for a line

Geoff wrote this program.

## Assignment 2: next stop information

I wrote this program.

## Assignment 3: CSV and Pandas

I wrote this Jupyter notebook.

## Extra Credit:

Geoff adapted my assignment 3 in development of the extra credit project.
