# HW 11

### Roles:

I split this assignment with Geoff. I did assignment one while he did assignment two.

### Assignment 1:

In assignment one we use a NYC Census Tract shapefile to find out in which tract CUSP is located. 

### Assignment 2:

In assignment two we used time series of establishments by NYC zipcode to demonstrate clustering techniques. Clustering the zipcodes by number of establishments shows that there is a downward trend in zipcodes with many business and an upward trend in the middle group.
