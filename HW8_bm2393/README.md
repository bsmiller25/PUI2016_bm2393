# HW8

I mostly worked alone on the lab because I finished most of it in class. I did help a few people clean up community district names for merging.

### Lab:

I finished the in class lab. This involved reading in data, cleaning it, combining it with other data, and drawing conclusions. 

### Plot assessments:

I also had to critique two classmates' plots. I provided feedback through github pull requests.
